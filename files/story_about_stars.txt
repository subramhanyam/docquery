Title: The Whispering Stars

Once upon a time, in a quiet village nestled between misty hills, a curious child named Mira spent her nights staring at the stars. Her grandmother had always said the stars whispered secrets to those who truly listened.

One night, Mira climbed the tallest hill and sat in silence. As the wind danced through the trees, she heard a soft hum above. The stars began to shimmer brighter, and a voice as gentle as moonlight spoke to her.

"Seek the light within, and you shall understand the sky."

From that night on, Mira never missed a stargazing moment. She became an astronomer, uncovering celestial mysteriesâ€”but she always believed the stars spoke just to her.

And maybe, just maybe, they did.
